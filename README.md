+ Project summary: In this project, we created CNN predicted model to classify images uing  convolutional layer and transition block for model 1.
	
**Contribution statement**: 
Shuangxian Li: For model1, she created CNN predicted model to classify image data, I tried to use convolutional layer to reduce the high dimensionality of images and the then used transition block between two dense blocks acts as a down sample operation, reducing the number of feature maps and the feature maps size to half. She searched and collected related paper from [Andreas Veit](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Veit_Learning_From_Noisy_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) to inspire our model design process for model2.
