Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) is a subtype of Neural Networks (NN) which is mainly used for image applications.
Convolutional layer reduces the high dimensionality of images without losing important information.


For the given dataset, we implement a CNN model described as below.
The CNN model starts with a first single convolutional layer. Then followed by two pairs of dense block â€” transition blocks pairs, a third dense block.
Dense block is a module that connects all layers (with matching feature-map sizes) directly with each other.
Transition block between two dense blocks acts as a down sample operation, reducing the number of feature maps and the feature maps size to half.
And then the model is followed by the global average pooling layer to flatten the output feature. 
Finally, the flattened vector is fed to the dense layer to do classification.
